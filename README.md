The index.html contains all major part

The noise.html contains only the noise effect

Noise generated using CSS, created by animating repeating-radial-gradient

noise.htm is connected with index.html by a <a> tag inside a button div

every circular buttons are clickable & connected to a specific youtube video

Everything created/generated only using very basic CSS properties

## Two Difficult Things That I Did Using CSS & JS

1. Creating the NOISE EFFECT using CSS
2. Connecting different YouTube videos to different Buttons using JS
